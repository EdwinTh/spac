Part 1: database creation:

(A) Fetch historical data:
    (1)(x) Code in place to download all daily data of a ticker from API.
    (2)(x) Code in place to clean a single ticker.
    (3)(x) Wrapper code to loop over a list of tickers and perform (1) and (2)

(B) Get list of all current SPACs premerge:
    (1)(x) Scrape https://stockmarketmba.com/listofshellcompanies.php
    (2)(x) Postprocess and create table current_spacs

(C) Get list of all merged SPACs:
    (1)( ) Scrape https://spactrack.net/closedspacs/
    (2)( ) Postproces and create table merged_spacs

(D) Create overview of all SPAC histories:
    (1)( ) Apply (A) on all in (B)
    (2)( ) Apply (A) on all in (C) on the pre and post merge tickers
    (3)( ) Combine in the table daily_overview

(E) Updating functions:
    (1)( ) For (A) make sure we only read the data not yet in the database
    (2)( ) Write checks that assure data completeness

(F) Find the dates of the merger announcements:
    TODO see if these are collected, if not, handwork.
